Issue Number 1
    In the method setSalary, the line salary=salary is not inside an else statement. This means that
    this code will execute no matter the result of the if statement. So even if the salary is less than 
    0, it will still be assigned to salary.
    To correct this, enclose salry=salary in an else statement.
    In addition, use this keyword to specify that the salary class field is the one we are assigning the
    parameter salary to. Otherwise, the compiler will not know which salary is being referred to.
    if (salary < 0) {
            System.out.println("Salary cannot be negative");
        }else{
            this.salary = salary;
        }

Issue 2:
    The field salary has not being initialized in the constructor. To add a salary, the method setSalary
    will need to be called separately each time. For cleaner code, setSalary should be called inside the 
    constructor.
    public EmployeeManagement(String name) {
        employeeName = name;
        setSalary(salary);

        }
Issue 3:
    employeeName field is not being validated. A user could pass an empty name and it would be accepted.
    A setEmployeeName setter method should be used for validation and then called inside the costructor.
    public void setEmployeeName(String employeeName) {
        if(!employeeName.trim().isEmpty()){
            this.employeeName = employeeName;
        }else{
            System.out.println("Invalid Name");
            //throw error
        }
        
    }
    public EmployeeManagement(String name) {
        setEmployeeName(name);
        setSalary(salary);

    }

Issue 4: 
    The method calculateBonus is returning a double value while the method itself is void. A void method
    does not return any value. To fix this, change from void to double.
    public double calculateBonus() {
        return salary * 0.1;
    }
